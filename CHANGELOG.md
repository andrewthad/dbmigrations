dbmigrations changelog
----------------------

1.0
---

- Added support for (optionally) adding timestamps to generated
migration filenames (thanks Matt Parsons <parsonsmatt@gmail.com>)
  * Adds flag for time stamp on file names
  * Adds configuration for timestamping filenames
- Added new "linear migrations" feature (thanks Jakub Fija≈Çkowski
<fiolek94@gmail.com>, Andrew Martin <amartin@layer3com.com>). This
feature is an optional alternative to the default behavior: rather than
prompting the user for dependencies of new migrations (the default
behavior), linear mode automatically selects dependencies for new
migrations such that they depend on the smallest subset of migrations
necessary to (effectively) depend on all existing migrations, thus
"linearizing" the migration sequence. See MOO.TXT for details.
- Configuration file loading now defaults to "moo.cfg" in the CWD if
--config-file is not specified, and environment variables override
settings in the config file
